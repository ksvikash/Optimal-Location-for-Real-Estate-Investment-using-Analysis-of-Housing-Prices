Optimal Location for Real-Estate Investment using Analysis of Housing Prices.
To purchase a villa, flat or flat without incurring losses and bankruptcies, it is essential to review, analyze and select the ideal neighborhood or location. Decisions must be made with care and deliberation in order to select a house that provides substantial financial support during difficult circumstances. This paper focuses on the importance of finalizing an optimal location a person should buy a house in, provided the budget and amenities he/she requires. Several factors influence the decision making of choosing the right house such as location, square feet price, amenities etc. available in the vicinity. With a dataset consisting of 6 major metropolitan cities and their housing prices, a machine learning model such as Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines(SVM), etc. is used to analyze them. The results indicate that certain city neighborhoods offer higher returns on investment than others. The analysis emphasizes important factors to consider when selecting a location for real estate investment, including proximity to transportation, availability of essential amenities, and projected economic development in the region. Individuals interested in real estate investment can use this document to make informed judgements about where to invest their money. The findings also provide policymakers and urban planners with insight.

All these evaluations and predictions are done with the help of machine learning to help customers match their housing location ideas. The algorithms used here are KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree. These algorithms help to provide higher accuracy for the dataset model as they carefully select the features of the data set and tune the hyperparameters like distance metrics, coefficients, etc. So selecting the factors becomes very important as the model provides optimized values to the customers. The actual and predicted values are compared to give the most optimized value using the built model and the customer takes suggestions from the output of the model.
